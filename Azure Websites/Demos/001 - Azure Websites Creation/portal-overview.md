Since we will be working with Websites in the rest of the demo, It's a good idea to show how easy it is to add other things like a Virtual Machine right from the portal, which in turn gives a brief overview of the mechanics of the portal. Don't worry about completely adding a new Virtual Machine however do follow the wizard to create one and explain that once finished their server will be available in 5-6 minutes.
